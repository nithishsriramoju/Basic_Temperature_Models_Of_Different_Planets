# Basic_Temperature_Models_Of_Different_Planets

##### This project aims to model vertical temperature profile data using collected from Planetary Atmospheres by F.W.Taylor 

##### Vertical Temperature Models are programmed using simple assumptions like presence of Atmospheric layers, Convection and In the Mars case two cases i.e. with dust and without dust influence

##### Temperature profiles of Earth, Mars, Titan and Venus are presented

##### In the case of Venus, we observe modelled temperature profile is very close to observed temperature profile

##### In the case of Titan, vertical temperature profile of Titan is close upto 50 km. From 30 km the haze layer starts in Titan, which contains hydrocarbons, deviates temperature profile from modelled profile by absorbing incoming radiation.

##### In the case of Mars with dust influence, the modelled profile’s deviation is very high from observed profile. The slope is low compared to figure without dust intervention

##### In the case of Mars without dust influence, vertical temperature profile is highly unstable due to frequent occurrence of dust storms. The profile is highly sensitive to day-night cycle and yearly insolation cycle. The modelled profile’s deviation is very high from observed profile.

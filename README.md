# Basic_Temperature_Models_Of_Different_Planets

##### Vertical Temperature profile data collected from Planetary Atmospheres by F.W.Taylor 

##### Vertical Temperature Models are programmed using simple assumptions like presence of Atmospheric layers, Convection and In the Mars case two cases i.e. with dust and without dust influence

##### Temperature profiles of Earth, Mars, Titan and Venus are presented

##### In the case of Earth,
